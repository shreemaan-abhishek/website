If you are here you probably already know me or want to know me because you read (and maybe liked) my writeup... or... you really don't know much about me :P. Here it comes:

> I am a geeky ambivert and a workaholic person who thinks sarcasm is seriously important.

I am a software engineer by profession, who loves building cool stuff; often caught procrastinating on "want to do" projects, lol. I enjoy diving deep into technical details and low level stuff particularly interest me a lot.

I am an enthusiastic enthusiast, I enjoy studying and learning about a LOT of stuff, new learnings fascinate me. Music theory is a topic of specific interest for me right now. And yea, I am really passionate about music too. I love singing and playing (still learning tbh) my guitar. I am a creative person too, I make jokes (mostly silly) out of thin air, I sketch, I like creative writing. Being able to put my thoughts concisely and strongly in words is one of my strengths.

I started this blog to mostly to post my brain dumps, and record some techincal stuff that I learn in daily basis. And as I am writing this on a hotel bed not being distracted by the busy Mumbai street visible from the window, I am realising that writing is kooooool. Whatever used to just go through my brain is being put out on a medium, it's as if I am getting to know myself better.

So here's to more writings ðŸ¥‚.
